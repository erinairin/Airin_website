	Family means having someone to love you unconditionally in spite of you and your shortcomings.
	Family means loving and supporting one another even when it's not easy to do so.  It’s being
	the best person you could be so that you may inspire your love ones. Family is unrelenting,
	it’s secure and reliable. Family isn’t just important, it’s what is most important!

	It originally contain 7 people including my parents, brothers, sisters and me. As time goes by, both of my brothers
	got married to their spouse and added another two person into our family, and from then on, it became bigger and bigger

	most of my sibligs already live on their own especially my brothers and sister-in-law as
	they have their own little family now. Whenever we gather around my parents' house, we rarely take family photos like this. It usually happen during raya,
	especially on the first day of raya during midnight. Both are taken around the same time but one year apart. I love how even though it's
	midnight, our energy are still high that it makes all of our raya photos look good.</p>

	<p style="font-size:20;text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; margin:3% 10%; color: #4A3C31;">
	This special section are meant to highlight these two people that i called Ayah and Ibu, who have made my life bearable.
	Ayah and ibu has made my life so much easier without me realizing it up until I have become an adult. They always work
	hard to give me the things that I need and want in life that it makes me realize that being a parents are not as easy as
	how they make it looked like. They never really show their struggles to satisfy the needs of their family. Always try and
	try until they know that we got everything that we need.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20;text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; margin:3% 10%; color: #4A3C31;">
	Ofcourse we did not always get what we want. Ibu and Ayah always told me that "if you want something, save your own money".
	I remember how I bought my first phone using my duit raya and school allowance. And ever since, I always worked on it myself
	most of the time. Even on things that they can obviously afford for me, they always encourage me to be more responsible with money
	and the way I plan and manage life for the best future. Growing older, I realize that this practice are not all about money. 
	It thought me so much more as a person, how your own hardwork can bring you to success and to the things that you want. I also learn
	how responsibility are so important in life that living with it can make me closer to my target in life.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20;text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; margin:3% 10%; color: #4A3C31;">
	Thankyou for all your love and sacrifices that have been made while raising our family, Ayah and Ibu.

	And this is my nephews. They are my second brother's sons and they are very cheeky and energetic. My first nephew named Aisy Naufal
	and his little brother named Aisy Nazhan. Naufal is 6 years old and he is really active. He likes badminton so much after their dad sent
	them to badminton classes a few times. He now wanted to be a number one badminton player <sub>lee zi jia</sub>, well even greater than number
	one. Everytime they came to my parents' house, Naufal always asked everyone to play badminton match with him, nonstop but his aunts are not
	really an active people so me and my sisters only entertain him with two round each.

	Nazhan is 3 years old, and also very energetic. He does not have one interest yet. What I can say is that he is really into cars, fishing
	and food. Yup, he can eat my portion of food. That's how a big eater he is. Well, when you eat big, your energy are also big. He is also 
	the cheekiest among them two. He knows how to talk funny about other people and how random he can be sometimes. The way he talks about something 
	never fails to make the whole family laugh.

One thing about having a nephew is that you always want to buy something for them. As for me, I always wanted to buy them things such as:</p>
